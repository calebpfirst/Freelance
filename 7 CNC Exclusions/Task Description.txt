Hey Caleb! Been using the program you made for me before, works great, just trying to do a small modification to it, but failing. Feel like it should be easy, just want it to not apply on any lines where the value of Z is 0 (or alternatively, where the line contains G53, but either works). Could you give me a hand with it? Tried if (line.z != 0) and (Zs != 0), or >0 in either case, but nothing. I've made another small mod to the program which is working, but shouldnt be affecting this. Can send code over anyway if you like? Let me know, and of course happy to pay for your time. Hope you are well.
